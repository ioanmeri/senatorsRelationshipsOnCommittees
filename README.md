# Senators Relationships On Committees


### Goal of this project was to make a graph that shows relationships between US senators on different committees.

[Check the Graph](https://d3-directed-graph.herokuapp.com/ "D3 Deployed")

*Note: Initial load may take a while because inactive apps hibernate*

* D3 is used to visualize the data as a **force directed graph**.
* The data show senators (most of them are democrats and republicans) on committees and are stored in a csv file.
* Toggle functionality for certain committees is supported and the graph updates to only show senators from these committees.

Note: Local http-server is required to run the app (in a order to make the csv request)
