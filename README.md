# Senators Relationships On Committees


### Goal of this project was to make a graph that shows relationships between US senators on different committees.

* D3 is used to visualize the data as a **force directed graph**.
* The data show senators (most of them are democrats and republicans) on committees and are stored in a csv file.
* Toggle functionality for certain committees is supported and the graph updates to only show senators from these committees.
